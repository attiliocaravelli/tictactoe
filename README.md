Challenge
=======================================

Tic tac toe game

Input

The first line gives the number of test cases N. N test cases follow. For each test case there will be:
● One line containing the value P, the next player to play on the board.
● Three lines containing the tic-tac-toe board, containing the set of characters ‘X’,
‘O’ or ‘_’.
You can assume that there are no illegal inputs in the test cases, and there will not be any illegal states given in the input (for example, you will not get a test input that has N number of ‘O’ in play and M number of ‘X’ in play where N > M+1, or have a tic-tac-toe board that has all the positions filled up).

Output
For each test case, output one line containing “Case n: “ followed by either “X wins”, “O wins”, “Draw” depending on the results of the solver. Output should go to STDOUT.
